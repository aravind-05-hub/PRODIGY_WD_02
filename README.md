Internship Task Completion: Web Development â€“ Stopwatch Application

I am pleased to share that I have successfully completed my internship task focused on web development. As part of this task, I developed a fully functional Stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project involved:

Structuring the layout using HTML

Styling the interface with responsive and user-friendly CSS

Implementing core stopwatch functionalities (start, stop, reset, and lap features) using JavaScript

Through this task, I strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and time-based logic in JavaScript, as well as enhanced my frontend development skills.

This hands-on experience has contributed significantly to my growth as a web developer, and I look forward to taking on more complex challenges in the future.
